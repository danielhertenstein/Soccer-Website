<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I am a 25 year old aspiring soccer manager currently living in Delaware. My current coaching responsibilities are that of a U10 Boys assistant coach. My thirst for knowledge of all aspects of coaching and managing knows no bounds, and I also draw on what experience I can from my mathematics and engineering background.</p>
