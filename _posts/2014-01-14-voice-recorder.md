<p class="lead">I have a voice recorder that I use to record various thoughts that I have about soccer. This post contains everything that I have recorded thus far. I will be expanding things here out into their own topics as time passes.</p>

**On session planning**: Every session has a central theme, whether it be something general like shooting or passing or something specific like flighted balls. How often can you repeat a specific theme? At the U10 age group, it seems like repeating dribbling is a good idea.

**Practice vs Playing**: Practice with more intensity than when playing. Playing the game is where you have fun, be creative, and express yourself. Training is hard work. It is focus. It is where you perfect technical and tactical skills so that when you go out and play, you don't have to worry about those things as much and you can be creative.

**Working with other coaches**: Always work with the other coaches available to you. It is likely that they will be intelligent human beings. They will have good ideas on certain topics. Any differing opinions they have from your views presents you with an opportunity to question your opinions. And it is always good to have someone to bounce ideas off of.

**Child Psychology**: I need to look into this. How do children think at each age group? How do their mental capabilities evolve? I don't think that it is easy for me to think like a child anymore.

**New Drills**: Always try the drills that you want to do on yourself or your friends first.

**Making runs**: Making runs has one or both of two objectives. The first is to make yourself available for a pass. The second is to create space for another player to run into. Ideally, your runs make you available for a pass and create space for another player to receive a pass as well. There is definitely a distinction between making abritrary space and making useful space.

**Player Personalities**: What type of playes do I want in my squad? I like intelligence and calmness, but do I need people with fire and aggression too? Think of players like Pepe. You may not like his personality, but is it effective on the field (minus the underhanded things)?

**Scouting**: How does scouting work? Do the scouts talk to agents at all? Do coaches talk to potential players often?

**Winning throw-ins and corners**: Professional players purposefully play balls off of their opponents to get a throw-in or a corner. This is a useful skill to teach your players.

**Video Analysis**: Is there some camera configuration that can allow for playback from the viewpoint of every player? This would give the player the ability to look back at a certain situation, see what was around them, see what they missed, and see what they should have done. Add in Oculus Rift?

**Plays**: Certain types of analysis are difficult because of the open, flowing natural of soccer. Are there way to define certain passages of play as "plays". For instance, a misplaced pass that leads to a goal could be the start of a "play". I could then coach specific ways to transition when regaining possession in certain circumstances.

**Club Analysis**: I should do analysis of certain club teams to see how they became successful. Soccernomics touched on this a little.

**Statistics**: I need to make sure that perform statistical analysis on my coaching properly. For instance, when I conduct an experiment with a certain drill, what kind of sample size will I need to make sure that my results are meaningful?

**Academy Crosstraining**: I think it would be a good idea to have my players play fustal in the winter and beach soccer in the summer. Playing these slightly different games will develop a broader sense of problem solving and spatial reasoning. Players will likely also develop more technical skills that they can creatively apply to regular soccer. I don't know if I would need to make my own league for these though. Hopefully, there will be leagues already that my players could join. One thing I will need to consider is if the less time they will have training in regular soccer is more of a detriment than playing futal and beach soccer is a gain.

**Other sports**: Is it valuable to cross train in other sports like basketball, hockey, and handball? These are all invasion sports. It might be easier to learn some concepts in these sports instead of soccer. I wonder if there are other valuable skills to be learned from non-invasion sports as well.

**Training Session Flexibility**: Both player quality and number of players will vary between team and practice. I need to make sure that I can adjust for such things during my sessions. I need to have backup drills.

**Winning**: I think one of the challenges that may arise is motivation for players and the focus on winning. In the E course, it was emphasized that they focus should not be on winning. This suggests that players could already be focused on winning. How do I get the focus on improvement? The focus should be on improving technical skills, creativity, mental skills, problem solving, etc. One of the ways I think I could do that is by changing the definition of winning. I might be able to get players to define winning as completing challenges that I set for the players before the game (such as take three shots or complete five passes in a row) or by having them conduct and experiment on the field (what happens when I try to dribble past a player going left versus going right?). Note: I have since changed my opinion on this a bit. I still want my players to focus on improving their skills, but I also want them to want to win and remain competitive.

**Troublemakers**: How do I deal with players who act like they don't want to be there? Players that openly mock the coaches, the players, the referees. Players that don't listen and also distract other players when you are explaining a drill. Players that purposefully do not follow the directions of a drill. I don't quite know yet. 

**Egocentrism**: I have seen a lot of information saying that at the U8 age group and the U10 age group, the game is still very egocentric and you shouldn't expect your players to pass the ball that often. It's more about building individual skill. But when they are playing, if they try to dribble past the entire team, they will likely fail at some point and the other team will get the ball. If that is all my playes do, they will likely never score a goal. If I have them organized defensively, it is less of an issue, but I do not think that is the answer as it will result in 0-0 draws. I could shift towards more passing, but the question is "How much?". I do not want to get in the way of individual development. How are the teams supposed to play at these age groups?

**Chronic Injuries**: There shouldn't be any chronic injuries that soccer player should have. It was recently talked about that Gareth Bale has some chronic injury due to is common amoung soccer players. I feel as though this should not be the case. There is obviously something wrong with his mechanics and his injury must have been preventable. I need to research what the common injuries are and make sure that I train my players to never get them.
