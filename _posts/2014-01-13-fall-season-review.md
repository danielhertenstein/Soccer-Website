title: Fall 2013 U10 Boys Season Review
encoding: ascii-8bit
---
<p class="lead">The season, running eight weeks from September 7th to November 2nd, was my first ever soccer coaching experience. I volunteered to be the assistant coach for a U10 Boys team in my club’s developmental league. It was an experience of great learning, and I enjoyed every second of it. This post details the events of the season and the many lessons that I learned. I will use the knowledge I have gained as a starting point for the spring season and to guide the research I will do in the winter.</p>

##Season Format
The first Saturday was considered “Opening Day” in which I met my team, held an abbreviated practice, and scrimmaged within the team. Every following week of the season contained a single sixty minute practice and a fifty minute game (two twenty-five minute halves). Practice day varied based on team (mine was Thursday evenings) and games were always on Saturday mornings. My practice on the week of September 9th was canceled due to me and the head coach being away on business trips, my practice and game on the week of October 6th were canceled due to rain, and I was unable to attend my game on the week of September 29th.

##Opening Day
Opening Day was a bit odd. The head coach was unable to attend, and that meant that I was conducting my first practice on my own. I had planned a session which required each player have a ball for the majority of the practice. Unfortunately, the players were told that Opening Day was a game, and so we only had one ball for every two players. My planned session was as follows:

1. Dribbling through gates: Place gates randomly in our playing area. Each player has a ball and dribbles through gates for two minutes. After two minutes, tell the players to go through as many gates as they can in one minute. Have everyone shout how many they got. Repeat once more and tell the players to try to beat their previous number.
2. 3v3 dribbling to the endline: Serve the ball to one team and the two teams attempt to stop the ball on the opposite endline. The losing team rotates out. 
3. Scrimmage: In the preseason coaches meeting, we were told to end Opening Day with a scrimmage. I would have done this anyway. It is my philosophy that practices at this age should always end with playing soccer.

Due to the lack of soccer balls, the session went:

1. Passing back and forth in pairs: I did the basic, pair up and pass back and forth, in an attempt to gauge ability levels. Unfortunately, I believe that I spent too much time looking at the team as a whole and that I should have spent a short amount of time with each pair.
2. Pairs dribbling to and passing through gates: This replaced the “dribbling through gates” that I had wanted to do. Each pair would head towards a gate, one dribbling and one running, and the dribbling player would pass to the running player through the gate. To detract from this exercise, we had an odd number of players and so I paired up with one of the players. This meant that I wasn’t watching the team much during the execution of the drill. On the positive side, this exercise got the players communicating as they had to decide upon which gates to go to next.
3. Two lines alternating shooting: I’m not sure what possessed me to do this, and I hope to never do it again. I decided that I wanted to work on shooting, and this was the only way that I could think of at the time. I had all the balls in the center of the 18-yard box, and alternated passing to each line for the receiving player to shoot. I rotated goalkeeper every so often. While this exercise did give the players shooting practice and I kept the pace relatively quick, I very much disliked having the players standing in lines.
4. 3v3 dribbling to the endline: The endlines were set up roughly 25 yards away. Stopping on the lines proved to be too difficult for the players. They tended to clump, especially when the ball was near the endline and the teams were battling to stop the ball. I believe that the exercise would have been more successful if I had, instead, placed three goals on each endline and changed the objective to dribbling through any of the goals.
5. Scrimmage: The scrimmage lasted roughly 25 minutes. I used a little less than half of the field and used the normal sized goals. Teams were 4v4+keepers. Both the size of the playing area and the goals felt too big. Since I only had nine players, I played defense on one of the teams. I wound up not needing to get too involved, and the unevenness was hardly noticeable. Positioning was a bit of a mess, and defenders either stood too far back and left their attackers stranded, or clumped with everyone. I identified teaching the concept of support as important.

At the end, I asked the players what they liked about the hour. Answers were split between scrimmage and winning. I asked what they didn't like about the hour. The only answer given was losing. I was hoping for better answers, but I guess the answers indicate what they are focused on. Overall, it was a huge learning experience. I realized that I needed to prepare much more than I had, so as to be ready for circumstances like not enough balls or variable amounts of players. Another thing I noted was that I did not have the players stretch. I had wanted to start with five minutes of light stretching, but the players were very antsy, wanting to kick the nearest ball anywhere, and I got the feeling that they would not have liked it. I did not want my first interaction with my players to start with a negative experience.

##Week Two (9/9/2013)
As I stated previously, practice this week was canceled due to myself and the head coach being away on business trips. To make up for some of the lost time, we asked the parents to arrive at the game thirty minutes early to hold a short practice. Our idea was to introduce the head coach to the team and give the players some instruction on how to play.

As it turns out, only a few players arrived early. The head coach and I used this time to work on some passing and moving and talk about general play principles. The principles included providing passing options for teammates and the concept that when we have the ball, everyone is on offense, and when they have the ball, everyone is on defense. We did not want any of our players to “stay back on defense” and not be involved.

###The Game
During the game, I was in charge of assigning the players positions and organizing substitutions while the head coach kept things on the field flowing and gave instructions to the on-field players. I also took it upon myself to talk with the players on the sideline to get a feel for their thinking and see if I could change their focus from winning to improving and having fun. 

The game went by well, I have no idea what the score was, but the players seemed to enjoy themselves. Our main weakness, as I identified in the Opening Day scrimmage, was spacing. The players were consistently clumped and the resulting soccer was lessened due to it. Another weakness was the positioning of our keepers. We rotated keepers to get everyone who wanted to play a chance, and they consistently stood on the goal line as opposed to a couple steps in front of it.

Over the course of the game, I was able to identify one of our players as far better than the rest of the team. I hoped to be able to use that to help the other players improve. I also found that one of the players had an attitude problem. At one point during the game, he told me that I was annoying because I talked to much. And, one of our players was completely new to soccer yet, surprisingly, he was one of the best defenders during the game.

Looking forward to the next (and technically our first) practice, I decided to look into games that would encourage the players spreading out and supporting their teammates without standing on top of them.

The head coach believed that spacing would continue to be an issue that is inherent to this age group in the developmental league and that improvement in the area should be our long term goal for the season. I agreed with this and resigned myself to not being able to completely solve this problem in a single practice. 

##Week Three (9/19/2013)

###The Practice
In general, I wanted our practices to follow the flow that is recommended in the US Soccer Federation curriculum: warm-up, small-sided activity, expanded activity, game, and cooldown. With our sixty minutes, the breakdown of time would go as follows:

1. Warm-up - 10 minutes
2. Small-sided Activity - 10 minutes
3. Expanded Activity - 15 minutes
4. Scrimmage - 20 minutes
5. Cooldown - 5 minutes

But I had no problem deviating as was needed.

The head coach and I had identified spacing as the topic we wanted to focus on in an attempt to remedy the clumping tendencies of our players. My research resulted in a number of ideas.

[Gate Dribbling](http://www.footy4kids.co.uk/dribble_through_the_gate.htm): A possible warmup. Have the kids count how many gates they get through in a minute without going through the same gate twice in a row. Do it again, see if they beat their score. Then have a few of the kids grab pinnies and be defenders. They just try to kick the ball away (without hurting their teammates). Players with balls try to get through as many gates as possible. Do it again, see if they beat their score. Could rotate defenders after the first one.

Application to spacing: Control the number of gates and their placement to cause the best amount of congestion (what that is, I am not sure yet). Tell the kids that if they are in a clump, they will be slowed down. If there is a clump, there must be completely open gates elsewhere that they can easily get to. If there is a clump, the defenders will have an easier time.

[Angle of Support Possession Drill](http://www.soccerxpert.com/soccerdrills/id1268.aspx): A possible warmup. Size of playing area may need to be tweaked. Players should probably be able to hit a pass across the entire playing area. Try to get X passes in a row without the defender touching it, then rotate. If the defender gets the ball, they should immediately return it to the attacking team so the pace of the drill is kept relatively high. If the defender gets X touches before the attackers can get their X in a row, rotate. Add a second defender, do similar rules.

Application to spacing: Clumping of attackers will make the defender's job easier. Spreading out makes the defender run more and gives the attackers more time and space to work with.

[Blob Tag](http://www.footy4kids.co.uk/Blob%2520tag.htm): A possible warmup.

Application to spacing: Players with balls will want to spread out to make it hard on the blob and easier on themselves.

In addition to a warmup exercise (or in place of), include some basic ball familiarity drills to allow the players more touches. Any of the exercises from the [Ball Skills Wiki](http://ballskills.wikispaces.com/1000TouchPractice) are probably good.

[Three Team Keepaway](http://www.footy4kids.co.uk/3_team_keepaway.htm): A possible small-sided activity.

Application to spacing: Clumping makes the job of the defense easier. Defenders will have to find the best positions to stand in to cover the most people.

[Four Corners Passing Game](http://www.soccerxpert.com/soccerdrills/id1266.aspx): A possible small-sided activity.

Application to spacing: Defense cannot focus on one direction as the attackers will always have two directions they can attack. Attack shouldn't clump towards one goal as it makes the job of the defenders too easy.

For an expanded activity, 3v3 or 4v4 with 3 goals on each endline. Players must either dribble through a goal or pass (along the ground) through a goal depending on which we want to place emphasis upon. Team size and number of team will depend on how many kids are at practice.

End with a scrimmage.

Our practice wound up looking like:

1. Pairs Passing
    1. Stationary at a Fixed Distance: The head coach and I instructed the players to use both feet. 
    2. Back and Forth While Running Downfield
    3. Through Partners’ Legs: Same setup as (a), but the players had to be more accurate with their passes, and the partners were not practicing receiving.

2. Talked About Positions
The head coach brought a diagram to the practice showing strikers, midfielders, and defenders in color coded zones. He explained the basics of on-field positioning.

3. Kicked Two Balls Around While in Positions
We had the entire team spread out into positions, and had them pass two balls around. The goal was to give the players a feel for where their teammates would be.

4. 3v1s
3v1 keepaway in an enclosed area. This was to encourage teammates to get into supporting positions for the player with the ball.

5. 5v5 with 3 Goals on Each Endline
This encouraged the players to spread out laterally as they had more places to score.

And these were my notes on the practice:

1. Pairs Passing
    1. While this is a simplistic exercise, it's importance cannot be understated. At our players' skill levels, simple foot-eye coordination and proper technique with both feet is vital to work on. I noticed that a fair amount of kids were pretty bad at using their weaker foot, and when going between pairs, I noticed that some would stop using their weaker foot when I wasn't watching. We'd likely have to continuously remind them to use both feet.
    2. I had a hard time observing this one and therefore am not sure how effective it was. I wasn't really sure what to watch for or how to offer coaching for it. I suppose I could have stopped a pair at the end of a specific circuit and offer tips. I think we should have emphasized the pace of running (maybe a light jog?) and where the players should have aimed their passes (aiming to hit their partner in stride) more.

        Expansion Ideas: Using different parts of the foot for each circuit. Inside of the outer foot, outside of the inner foot, toe poke passes, laces passes, etc.
    3.  I very much liked this one. We had to adjust the distance and I think we got it right at the end. At the end I heard scores of mostly 1 and 3, and I like those because they sound like soccer scores. It seems like the right amount of challenging, but I have no real evidence to suggest that is correct.

        Expansion Ideas: Start at a close distance, have one person take a step back with each success. That person also moves a cone back with them. If they miss, start over, but leave the cone where it is. See how far back you can get the cone.

2. Talked about positions
I think this was beneficial. It laid important theoretical groundwork that we could then reference in the future. I think that we should continue to reinforce this concept and expand upon it at some point in the future. Once the players are comfortable with the idea of having specific responsibilities, we can do the shadow playing exercise where we teach them how to move as a team. I still worry that making the players think in terms of positions, at this age, hinders creativity and individualism, but my opinion is extremely uninformed.

3. Kicked two balls around while in positions
I don't think that this worked as intended. While we play 8v8, we had 10 players at practice and therefore had additional positions that don't exist during our games. The addition of a central midfielder was a problem. Every pass seemed to go to the central midfielder. The other problem was that people wanted to pass the ball to the farthest person instead of one of the closest people. I do think that this improved communication though. We got the players calling out to each other. Even still, I don’t see myself doing this again.

4. 3v1s
I am not entirely sure how this one went as I was paying attention to my group the whole time (NOTE: Due to the number of players at practice, I had to be in one of the groups). But within my group, I thought it was a great exercise. It had the players constantly moving, getting frequent touches on the ball. It also got them thinking about positioning in both support and defense. They also had to make fast decisions on who to pass to and also experimented with trying to trick the defender into thinking they were passing to the other person. I had an opportunity to stop my group and point out some positioning mistakes along the way. Unfortunately, I did not look at the other groups when I should have. I would love to do this exercise again without being in a group to be able to monitor everyone.

5. 3 goals 5v5
I thought this worked out pretty well. Players did a decent job staying in their positions and you had the great idea of giving the ball to players who were in their positions. I thought the field was a bit too long for its width though. To me, the purpose of the game is to force the players to spread out laterally. If the two sets of goals are closer, they have to defend all three goals at the same time.

###The Game
Unfortunately, I did not take good notes on this game. I did notice that the players clumped much less than in the previous game. They still did clump, but the degree to which they clumped was much less.

##Week 4 (9/26/2013)

###The Practice
The head coach and I decided to focus on dribbling in this practice. The head coach asked me to look at the dribbling practices outlined in the U-10 Practice Activities pdf that is hosted on the [US Youth Soccer](http://www.usyouthsoccer.org/coaches/) website. From all of the exercises in all of the dribbling practices, I came up with the following practice:

1. Warm-ups: One thing I wanted to emphasize was forms of dribbling (every step, every other, etc). Hopefully it wouldn't be too many things for them to concentrate on at once. 
    1. Ask players to dribble towards a cone 10 yards away. Just before they reach the cone they should turn the ball with the bottom, instep (laces), or outside of the foot and burst back to their starting point. A partner will then perform the same activity. Show (slowly) how to dribble forward and make a turn with each of the parts of the foot. Then, let them go! NOTE: We could also add a cone at each midway point. The players could do a cut around the cone.
    2. Ask players to circle around you or a cone 10 yards away. Ask them to dribble at you and then turn the ball away just before they reach you. Use the same parts of the foot to turn the ball as above. Act like a monster in the middle try to keep them away from you. Have fun!
    3. Ask players to dribble in and out of each other in a defined area. When another dribbler bars their path,  they should turn as you’ve just shown them. Watch and see what they’ve learned.

2. Small Sided Activities:
    1. Ask two players to play 1v1 to a cone. Beat your opponent and hit the cone. Encourage goals! Change partners about every minute. Rest as needed.
    2. Play 1v1 between two cones 12 yds apart. The objective is to hit your opponents goal. Each pair should have an area of their own to play on. Change opponents every minute or so.

3. Expanded Activities: 
    1. Start a dribble tag game in which several players without the ball are it, and they must tag a dribbler to get his ball. They exchange and the game continues. 

        or
    2. 3v3 with three goals on each endline.

        or
    3. Create several 10x10 yd areas. Have one chaser and three dribblers in each box (shark and fish). The shark (with no ball) should try to catch the fish for about 30 seconds. The fish should dribble away and protect their ball without going outside their box. Change chasers (sharks) regularly. Ask them to count the number of tags they achieve in a 30 second period. If a dribbler goes out of the defined area, they must stay out for the remainder of that 30 seconds only.

4. Scrimmage:
    1. Scrimmage with no restriction.

        or
    2. Set up an area (40 by 30 yds) with two goals and a few cones across the center line. Divide into two teams and play soccer with one restriction: any player who crosses the center line with the ball cannot pass. They must dribble at goal and shoot or lose the ball trying. 

We wound up doing the following:

1. Warm-up:
    1. Break the players into two groups. Dribble around in a designated area. On command, turn 180 degrees and accelerate in the other direction.
    2. Make a square of cones, have the players dribble around the outside of the square. Emphasize sharp turns and controlled touches.

2. Small Sided Activities:
    1. Sharks and Minnows. Two groups of five players. We started with one shark and four minnows, but transitioned to two sharks and three minnows.
    2. Divide players into pairs. Set up a cone 10 yards away. Have each player dribble to the cone, turn at the cone, and dribble back. Their partner then does the same.

3. Expanded Activities:
    1. Ask two players to play 1v1 to a cone. Beat your opponent and hit the cone. Encourage goals!

4. Scrimmage:
    1. Scrimmage with a 3 touch minimum restriction. The team lost the ball if they did not do this. This was to encourage dribbling.

Here are my post-practice notes:

1. Warm-up:
    1. Not a glamorous activity, but touches on the ball are touches on the ball and are of vital importance. My group was having a hard time bursting. 
    2. This prompted good controlled touches on the ball. I tried to get them to turn sharply at the corners, but they didn't seem to be able to do it. Though, I do think that the seed of the concept was planted as they were attempting it.

2. Small Sided Activities:
    1. I think that it was extremely successful. I had 5 people in my group. I started with one shark, but then most of the minnows could just stand around. I switched to two sharks and then it went much more smoothly. I told the sharks that they only needed to touch the ball to get a point. I rotated sharks as I saw fit. Eventually, one of my players was moved to the other group. At that point, I started to be a shark to retain the ratio.
    2. This started out a bit awkward, but after the head coach demonstrated the turn, it went a lot better. Turning is an important skill to have and I think we should address it again in the future.

3. Expanded Activities:
    1. This was a complete failure. The defenders just stood on the cone. This should have been done differently. Having a rectangular playing area where the defender serves the ball to the attacker and the attacker tries to get to the opposite side would have been infinitely better.

4. Scrimmage:
    1. I liked the restriction, but it was difficult to enforce. Our players still like to boot the ball away when on defense. I think we should work on dissuading them from doing so and get them to think about controlling the ball.

###The Game
Previously, I tried to do substitutions in groups. We had twelve players and played eight on the field at a time. I thought it would be best to divide the team into three groups of four and rotate groups. Unfortunately, players got tired at different rates, and not all twelve kids showed up every game. Therefore, we switched to doing subs individually. This was much better and we were able to keep track of who was playing where more easily.

I noticed that one of our players was a strong defender. He seemed to naturally grasp the concept of closing down attackers without immediately trying to go in for a tackle and take the ball. I thought this was something we could use when we do defensive exercises. Unfortunately, as the game went on, he became guilty of standing next to the goalkeeper even when the ball was down at the other goal.

I identified another player as being a good dribbler and having pace. I wanted to make sure that he continues to develop his dribbling skills without relying on his pace.

We have one player who was definitely our best player. He was all over the field, dropping back on defense to take the ball from attackers. He is a very good dribbler and our most physically developed player. I wonder about how we should be coaching him. He can overwhelm opponents with his size and speed, but that is an advantage that he will (likely) eventually lose. I think he needs to start learning some feints, cuts, etc. to improve his game.

We have one player who is very aggressive on the field. I saw him accidentally kick a number of opposing players in quick succession early on in the game. When he came off as a sub, I asked him to be more careful. He said that he didn't mean to kick them. I told him that I knew that was the case, but that he needed to wait for the right opportunities to take the ball.

Overall, we improved from last game. I think we improved more from last game to this game than from the first game to the second game. I think the dribbling practice helped more than I thought it did at the time.

I have realized that I need to start paying attention to individual players even more and try to think about what they are doing well and poorly and what they need to work on most during practice. There are a number of players that I couldn't tell you what their biggest weakness is because I haven't watched them closely enough. I can't give much of an evaluation of those players and I will be focusing on fixing that problem going forward.

##Week 5 (10/3/2013)

###The Practice
The head coach wanted to cover one of three of the topics in US Youth Soccer U-10 Practice Activities pdf: shooting, receiving, and shielding. He was unsure that he was going to be able to make it to practice, so he left the decision of deciding to me. I decided on receiving, and, from the pdf, came up with the following practice plan:

1. Warm-ups
    1. In pairs, with two balls, ask players to play catch with two balls at the same time. They can bounce the ball, arc it high or throw it to the side of the other ball. Activities like this are fun and stress working together. Challenge them to go fast.
    2. Challenge players to the same task with their feet. Let them figure out a solution.
    3. Ask players to dribble in and out of each other, changing speed and direction. On your signal each player should stop his ball and move on to any other ball. Repeat as above except that on your signal players should throw their ball in the air and get any other ball. On the exchange, ask players to move to, and control the ball as quickly as possible.

2. Small Sided Activities
    1. In threes, ask one player to stand in the middle of two others who are about 12 yards apart. The player in the middle will receive a pass from an outside player. Their challenge is to accept the ball with either foot and turn with it to pass to the other player. Repeat in the opposite direction. Show them how to receive the ball with the inside, outside or sole of the foot and then get them going. Let them know that they should receive and turn in a smooth motion. Don’t expect miracles.
    2. Put one player in the middle of four. Ask the player in the middle to receive the ball from any outside player and then turn and pass it to any other player. They would then get the ball back from that person and turn and pass to any other. The outside players should create a square about 12 yards on each side. Vary the size as you see fit. Ask players to move to the ball, receive and turn as smoothly as possible. With time it will come.
    3. Have four players in a line. Ask player B to receive a ball from player A, turn and beat player C and play the ball to player D. Repeat in the opposite direction. Balls can be rolled in by hand if accurate passing is difficult for the outside players. Change roles regularly.

3. Expanded Activities
    1. Inside the penalty box with 3v3, have players play keep away with successful passes being counted as points. Have them play in short 90-second sets, then bring in a new 3v3 group. Other players line the outside of the box to keep the game moving. True passes are those made accurately to feet or timed to a space where a player is running.
    2. In this activity the means of scoring is based on receiving the ball. Played on half the field in a 5v5 situation, each player that receives and redirects the ball in one motion scores a team point. Properly receiving a ball requires body preparation prior to touching the ball. If a player’s body is in a balanced position upon receiving the ball, his chances for success are heightened.

4. Scrimmage
    1. No restriction scrimmage.

The actual practice was mostly the same, but we did not do small sided activity 2, we used 4v4 teams in expanded activities 1 (we only had eight players at practice), did not do expanded activity 2, and scrimmaged with a two pass requirement before allowing shots on goal.

My notes were as follows:

1. Warm-ups
    1. Worked well.
    2. It took them a minute to get it for feet, but once they did, it was good. The distance may have been too far (6 paces).
    3. Went well. Definitely tired them out. Some of the kids liked to punt their ball away on a switch. When we switched by throwing, some of the kids were catching their own ball.

2. Small Sided Activities
    1. I thought that this was excellent.
    2. This was a bit too complicated for my group. The defender coming out defended too hard and the turner panicked and his pass was terrible. I think this should have been done a bit differently. Both defender and turner in the middle. Defender behind turner keeping a hand on his back, pressing passively. When the turner gets the ball, the defender stops defending and allows the turner to turn, go past, and pass. Also, because my group didn't get it, they disengaged and starting goofing around a bit.

3. Expanded Activities
    1. We tried counting the passes. Our two best players being on the same team seemed to give them a big advantage. One of the other players on that team staying in about the same place the entire time away from the group seemed to also help them as they always had an outlet pass to him. Surprisingly, all of the players seemed to dislike this game. They were all eager to move on to something else. I wonder if 4-a-side was too many people. They were all pretty clumped.

4. Scrimmage
    1. The restriction worked well. Our best player wasn't able to dribble downfield and shoot immediately. Unfortunately, our best defender spent too much time standing in front of his goal like a goalkeeper. I told him that to move up quite a few times, but he fell back quickly.

###The Game
I was unable to attend the game from this week, but the head coach sent me his notes.

There was an issue with supportiveness at the game. The opposing team scored two quick goals at the beginning of the game, and at least one of our players said some unsupportive things our goalkeeper. Our goalkeeper got upset and did not want to play again until after halftime. The head coach addressed this with the team and we did not have any such problems for the rest of the season. (As a side note, I think the goals used at this age group are much too large. There is very little a goalkeeper can do to prevent a goal besides hope the players shoot right at them.) 

Our best player began to be a ball hog. While I have read that I should not expect consistent passing at this age, the head coach said that he did not attempt a single pass all game. He also said that there was a lack of passing in general and that he wanted to scrimmage with a three pass minimum for the foreseeable future.

The head coach noted poor positioning again and that he wanted to reinforce the concept at next practice.

##Week 6 (10/10/2013)
Both our practice and game this week were canceled due to rain.

##Week 7 (10/17/2013)

###The Practice
I found [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bootroom/comments/1o064d/i_coach_a_group_of_u10_boys_and_im_having_trouble/) that I shared with the head coach as it contained some things I thought that we could use in practice. The head coach liked it, and after a few emails back and forth, I came up with this for a practice:

1. Warm-ups:
    1. Set up a two stage dribbling course, one for each pair of players. The first stage is a set of cones to weave through, emphasizing control. The second stage is a sprint towards a defender (a cone) and beat the defender.
    2. Set up triangles of cones with four people or squares with five people depending on group size. Each group has a ball, each player is standing at a cone with two players at the cone with the ball. The player with the ball passes the ball to the next person (in either direction) and follows their pass to that cone. The player receiving the ball receives it, moving the ball into position to pass to the next cone in one motion. They then pass and follow their pass. 

2. Small Sided Activities
    1. Two cones six paces apart. One defender, one dribbler. The dribbler tries to dribble to either of the two cones. The defender tries to block him without stealing the ball. The attacker will have a hard time beating the defender for pace, so they will need to use trickery. Give the dribbler 30 seconds, then switch. The main focus for us in this drill is to get the players to stop immediately going for the ball and the start thinking about positioning. 
    2. 1v1 to goal with no goalkeeper.

3. Expanded Activities
    1. 2v2 to goal with a goalkeeper.
    2. 3v2 to goal with no goalkeeper.

4. Scrimmage
    1. Scrimmage with a three pass minimum. I purchased small pop-up goals and we began using these for goals during the scrimmages instead of cones. The players liked them quite a bit.

During practice, we completed all of these activities with the exception of Small Sided Activity 1 and Expanded Activity 2. They were cut for time. Below are my notes from the practice.

1. Warm-ups
    1. I thought that this was a great warmup. The players were very engaged. It took only a minute for them to understand what to do. The weaving section may have been a little too wide. I thought that they were spaced well vertically, but too wide horizontally. The beating the defender part was pretty good. The players got really into it when I acted as the defender (without trying to steal). Even after I switched to a different line, they still were trying interesting things against the cone. I think acting as the defender got their creativity going.
    2. My group did decently. There were elements that they didn't get though. They didn't stand behind the cone and they didn't use their first touch to redirect the ball to set up their pass. Their passing was good. Once my group had 5 people, they started to get a little distracted.

2. Small Sided Activities
    1. I think this was the best part of the practice. The players were really engaged. Unfortunately, it was also the time when they were the least active (only two people playing at a time). Sending the defender out before the feed was good. We kept it going at a good pace, which I liked. Calling it over as soon as the defender got the ball away was good.

3. Expanded Activities
    1. This seemed awkward. To be honest though, I didn't see much of the play. The main thing that I noticed was the act of defending as a pair. Mostly it was one defender running to try to take the ball, and one defender standing back near the goal. I tried to organize the defenders while they were waiting, but I don't know how much good that did.

4. Scrimmage
    1. I didn't really notice a whole lot here. The players still clump too much.

Overall Thoughts: Working together is still our players' main weakness. They don't look for their teammates enough, and their teammates don't do a good enough job of providing options. The main issue the players have when providing a passing option is that they don't recognize when there is a defender between the two of them.

###The Game
The main thing that I noticed was that we did much better when the players were playing where we have identified as their best positions. While it is encouraging for the team to score goals and win, the main focus should still be giving players opportunities to play in different positions and improve. That said, I think we should start the game and end the game in our best formation. Starting the game that way provides the team with encouragement that they can carry into the middle of the game. Ending the game that way will serve to make the players forget about the possibly lower level of play in the middle of the game. Also, I think we should come up with a plan ahead of time for the lineups and rotations. I doubt we will be able to stick to it, but it can only help to have a plan. It can even be a partial lineup that we fill in the gaps with whoever is there or wants to try specific positions.

##Week 8 (10/24/2013)

###The Practice
The head coach wanted to run the following practice:

1. Warm-ups
    1. The head coach liked the dribbling exercise used in the previous week, but suggested two alterations. The first was that we end the exercise with a shot on goal. The second, to facilitate the first was to use just two courses, so they would each end going towards one side of the goal we had access to. I decided to add one more stage to the dribbling course. After the weaving section, the players performed a rollover dribble, moving laterally to the start of the “beating the defender” stage. We also decided to instruct the players to beat the defender using one of two moves, either a double feint or a stepover in one direction then going to the other direction.

2. Small Sided Activities
    1. 1v1 to goal with a goalkeeper with a focus on creative ways to beat the defender and finishing.

3. Expanded Activities
    1. 2v1 and 3v2 to goal. We will start with two attackers to one defender and make a 2-3 pass requirement. This will force them to support one another and also to think pass with an open man. We will then change it up to try same theme but on a larger scale on 3v2 and look for movement/support and good passes.

4. Scrimmage
    1. Scrimmage. He felt strongly that for this scrimmage we should put cones down the middle of the field and players on the right side of the field and left side of the field will not be able to cross the lines to prevent them from being ball magnets. We could also expand this possibly for offense and defense but we can see how the line down the middle works. This visualization may help them understand what we keep saying during the games.

Below are my notes on the practice.

1. Warm-ups
    1. The dribbling was okay. I think having two dribbling techniques to work on may have been too much. Perhaps it would have been better to remove the weave and focus on the rollover. I noticed some players having a hard time grasping the concept. I think it's okay that they struggled, as it is always difficult to practice a brand new skill. The beating the defender was pretty poor from what I saw. I'm not sure how we could have made it better. Maybe they should have slowed down more? Or maybe we should have gone with even simpler moves like a basic feint? The shooting also seemed poor. They seemed to pretty much just kick it and I had a hard time getting them to use their left foot. But maybe that's fine; after all, practice shots are practice shots. Maybe we should have focused on shooting technique more (plant foot position, drive with the knee, look at the spot on the ball that you want to hit, lean forward, follow through forward).

2. Small Sided Activities
    1. I thought that the 1v1 were great. I think the keeper was also good, as it made them think about their shot placement more. I think we could have given more instruction on 1v1 defending though. Specifically, when to try to steal the ball (when the player takes a heavy touch or when you know they're going to change direction).

3. Expanded Activities
    1. For the 2v1s and 3v2s, it went more smoothly with the single pass restriction and the no pass restriction. I understand having it in the beginning to condition them to use their teammates, but then the defender also knew what was going to happen. Once there were no restrictions, it seemed pretty fluid. I would have liked the defense to communicate more, but I think the seed was at least planted. Two of our the players did a great job calling who was covering the ball.

4. Scrimmage
    1. The line down the middle was a great idea. The size of the field seemed perfect too. I think the players really benefited from the small team sizes as well. Instead of there being a jumble of players, they knew where their teammates were. I felt bad for one player because his teammates did a poor job involving him. He was open constantly. I tried to get them to realize this, but it did not take.

###The Game
Our dribbling was definitely getting better. I noticed a lot of players able to dribble around defenders instead of trying to dribble through them. Shooting was also great and we had some powerful goals from players that I did not expect to see score.

Our positioning gets better every game, but we still have some players that aren't fulfilling their positional responsibilities. Our outside defenders like to get forward too much, leaving the lone central defender against multiple opponents. I tried remedying this by telling the central defender to direct the positioning of the back line a bit and tell them when they were getting too far forward, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that he did this very well. Anything that gets them talking more is good. Our attackers tended to drop back into the defense too often. When playing as a striker, our best player would stay near the back line when the ball was around our goal and when we recovered the ball, he was not available as an outlet. One player seemed to have no idea where to be when he was playing attack. He positioned himself more like a midfielder. I think this can be attributed to the fact that he hasn't been to a practice in awhile.

Our player vision in regards to passing still needs work. Our best player was very bad at playing the early pass to whoever was open ahead. He wasn't the only one who had that problem, but he was the most obvious. The danger we have to avoid there though is conditioning our players to punt the ball up the field and have our fast players run onto it and score. That will be harmful to their long-term development. Our best defender, while a great defender, is still stuck in the mindset of "I'll just kick the ball away as hard as I can." We have some others that still do this as well, and I'd love it if we could get them to, instead, find a teammate with a pass out to the sides or into the midfield.

Goalkeeping was better overall. I think the work that the head coach did with each of the players that went into goal was beneficial. They seemed better at picking up the ball when the opportunity was there.

##Week 9 (10/31/2013)

###The Practice
For our last practice, the head coach wanted to make sure that we at least introduced the proper techniques for heading and performing throw-ins. We had chosen to focus more on foot skills for the majority of the season, as heading and throw-ins came up very infrequently during games. Together, we decided on the following practice:

1. Warm-ups
    1. Dribble and Shoot Course: Shorter weave section (4 cones), keep the rollover (shorter length), and keep the beating the defender and shooting. As for the move to beat the defender, we decided to have the players do a single lunge in one direction and then go in the other direction. We also readdressed shooting technique.

2. Small Sided Activities
    1. The head coach and I demonstrate proper technique for headers and throw-ins. We then break the team up into two lines and have the players practice the techniques with us. Once we are content with their techniques, we pair them up and let them practice with each other. One performs a throw-in to the other. The other heads it back to the first. Repeat and then switch roles.

3. Expanded Activities
    1. 2v2 + 2 Neutral Wide Players: Normal 2v2 to goals but with a separate wide area on each side that spans the length of the field. Each wide area contains a neutral player. The neutral player is a part of whichever team has the ball at the moment. Teams can play a pass to the neutral player at any time. The neutral players are only allowed to pass. Coaching points here: Players should point to where they want their passes. Defenders need to call "I got ball!".

4. Scrimmage
    1. Scrimmage: Line down the middle of the field again. I wish I had taken better notes of the dimensions of the playing field that we used. I know it was 18 paces wide, but I don't know how long it was. We could do the dimensions for this game and the 2v2+2 game such that we just have to remove the lines for the wide areas to transition to the scrimmage.

We also decided to explain the offsides rule at this practice as we were called for it twice in the previous game. Unfortunately, we got a late start to the practice due to many players arriving late, and so we did not do the expanded activity. My notes for the practice follow.

1. Warm-up
    1. The kids continued to get better at it. The rollover was still tough for some. The moves continued to be awkward. The shooting was better. Players still tried to avoid using their left foot though. I can see the players benefiting from that warmup for weeks from now, but I wonder at what point it should be changed to something else to keep things fresh and to work on other skills.

2. Small Sided Activities
    1. The explanations for throw-ins and headers was slow due to our players' lack of attention. I do think they got much better over the course of the season, but it still bothered me. In the lines, the execution in my line was great. Some back feet came up on throws but, for the most part, they were good. The headers in line were great. Only one player in my line that struggled with headers. He was afraid of the ball. When the players were in pairs, I failed to see much to coach. I wound up spending my time telling players to stop fooling around. 

3. Scrimmage
    1. The scrimmage wasn't as good as last week. I think this was just due to the amount of people playing. I think the field should have been larger.

###The Game
Before the game, the opposing coach asked if we wanted to play 10v10 as both teams only had 10 of their 12 players there. We reluctantly agreed. I knew that this was a bad decision and should have suggested to the head coach that we just decline the offer. The first half resulted in extremely congested soccer with a level of clumping that we had not seen since the first game. We told the opposing coach that we wanted to revert to 8v8 in the second half and he agreed. 

Our biggest problem was a lack of passing, namely from our best player, again. Our dribbling was strong and even though our practice of moves may have been awkward, our players did a great job dribbling around opponents. Shooting was also strong. I didn't hear much good communication. I think we should have stressed communication and given them a specific vocabulary from the start. Goalkeeping was very strong this game.

##Lessons Learned
The most important lesson I learned is that I should prepare an overall plan for all of the practices ahead of time. This will ensure that I cover the topics I want to cover in whatever distribution I see fit. If my team is any indication of what my future teams will be like, I will make sure that combining with other players is the central theme of the season. Even getting players to work with one other player consistently would be a success.

I also realized the importance of dimensions in all practice exercises. The size of the playing areas and the distances for dribbling and passing exercises can be the difference between the success and failure of an exercise.

I learned that goalkeeper is a difficult position for the age group and that I did not address it enough during practice. In the spring, I will include some goalkeeper training that will hopefully have the added benefit of teaching the players how to better read the game.

One trait of my players that I will be looking for in the future and figuring out a way to remove is immediately punting the ball away on defense. Many of my players would kick the ball as hard as they could with their first touch without ever looking up for teammates. It will be one of my central teaching points to get my players to survey the playing field as much as possible and to find a teammate as much as possible.

My approach to games during the season was to tell the kids that the score didn’t matter and to just have fun and try new things on the field. I think that I was slightly incorrect in doing this. I think identifying who wins and who loses is important to develop competitiveness, and that I should stress more that there are no consequences for losing. I will still want my players to primarily focus on trying new things and being creative, but I also want them to strive to win. This is something that I think I will readdress multiple times throughout my career.

We did not have the player stretch at the beginning of practice during the entire season. It is something that I would like to do, but need to research more the best way to incorporate it into the practice without the players complaining. I know that the benefits of stretching at that age are not too great due to their natural flexibility and that doing the stretching is more to get them in the habit of stretching so they continue to do it when it will really benefit them. Dynamic stretching will likely be the way to go. I will be trying this out in the spring.

None of the exercises that we did during practice were ones where progress could be measured quantitatively. Having a mathematics background, I love the idea of getting data on my players and finding numerical ways to measure their progress. Warm-ups such as dribbling through as many gates as you can in one minute or juggling for a minute are two examples of exercises that can be tracked and progress can be seen. I will be including these types of exercises in my plans for the spring and looking for more ways to record data over the winter.

I need to come up with better ways to teach proper technique. Especially with shooting, the instruction we gave seemed to go in one ear and out the other. I will be doing extensive research over the winter on the best ways to present proper techniques for the skills I plan to teach.

Using both feet will need to be constantly repeated. My players would gladly only ever use their dominant foot. Even with instructing them to use both feet multiple times, they would quickly revert to only using their dominant foot.
