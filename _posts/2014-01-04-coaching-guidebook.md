title: The Guidebook
---
<p class="lead">One of the main motivations for this site is hosting the guidebook that I will be developing over the course of my life. This guidebook contains information on a multitude of topics and serves as my personal reference for all of the knowledge I have collected and view to be useful. I chose to host it online hoping that it will help others as well.</p>

You can access my guidebook [here](/guidebook) or by the link in the top bar. I also provide my guidebook in PDF form (when I decide on the best way to do so) if you prefer to read in that why or want to print it out (the feasibility of which will decline as I near my page number goal of Graham's Number).

The guidebook currently has a focus on U10 Boys coaching as that is my current coaching position. There is also content on seemingly random other topics that I was exploring before I started coaching. The majority of the content should be considered, for the moment, theorectical due to my lack of experience, but I need to lay the groundwork now to make my rise to Champions League Champion as fast and smooth as possible.

I know my coaching education will never be complete, and I will consider this a work in progress for forever; there will always be incomplete sections, questions to myself, and empty headings. I can only ask those of you who read this to be patient with me as I attempt to cover the endless topics involved. If there is something you think I need to cover immediately, do not hesitate to let me know via email. Similarily, if you know that a portion of my content is factually incorrect, please bring it to my attention. My errors ultimately impact my players the most, and the last thing I want to do is provide them with false information.
