<p class="lead">This post discusses how to introduce 1v2s, 2v1s, and 2v2s to youth players. It begins with the theory behind the progression, and then presents the associated exercises with details regarding how I will present the topics to the players.</p>

##Theory
At a certain age, and at the moment I’m led to believe that this age is 8/9 (how nicely that fits into my U10 coaching position), players begin to migrate from an egocentric view of the game to a team based view of the game. They begin to comprehend that they can work together to achieve greater success. Instead of dribbling down the length of the field themselves, they can pass the ball to a teammate who is in a better position than they are, and that teammate might even pass them the ball back. It was surprising to me how difficult this concept was for my players. To cultivate this type of thinking (and I do not think it necessary to motivate the need to cultivate this type of thinking), we must teach our players the relevant thought processes and place them in 1v2, 2v1, and then 2v2 situations that provide them a platform upon which to experiment.

###1v1 to 1v2 or 1v1 to 2v1?
My question to you is, which situation do you expose them to first? Do you add a second attacker or a second defender? I would argue that the second defender should be added first. 

####1v1 to 2v1
Consider the consequences of adding a second attacker first, a 2v1. On the attacking side, players are still inclined to ignore their partner and try to dribble past the lone defender. As long as they can win their 1v1, there’s no need to work together. Sure you can drill, “Use your teammate. Pass to your teammate. He’s wide open,” into their heads until they start to do it, but that’s not the way we want our players to learn. We shouldn’t force the growth of concepts, they should grow naturally as a consequence of their environment. 

On the defending side, the problem that needs to be solved is not properly motivated. While the attackers are still being selfish, ignoring their teammate, trying to beat the defender in a 1v1, the defender can also ignore the second attacker. Once you have convinced your attacker to start passing, then the defender actually has to consider multiple aspects of the situation, but we will see that this 2v1 problem solving comes more naturally when adding the second defender first.

####1v1 to 1v2
Now consider adding a second defender, a 1v2. On the attacking side, there is not much that you need to coach. You could argue that you should be teaching your players to try to separate the defenders and create a 1v1 situation, but I’d prefer the attacker to experiment here under no constraints. While it will be harder for the attacker to go right between the two defenders and, effectively, try to beat them both at the same time, why limit their options? They might be able to do it. More often than not though, they will not succeed on their own and will be wishing that they had a second attacker to help them. 

On the defending side, you are introducing the concepts of communication and assuming specific responsibilities within a pair in a favorable situation. The one defender will be closing down the ball and the other will be supporting the first defender and providing instructions of where to go. You do have one potential problem to avoid: both defenders rushing the ball. I will prevent this by making the second defender wait five seconds before they can help. This has the added benefit of being a more realistic situation as your defense is not usually playing grouped in pairs of two. With this approach your first defender is focused on slowing the attacker down while he waits for his support to arrive, and your supporting defender gets time to examine the situation and decide how best to direct this partner.

###Turning the Tables
If we assume that the 1v2 has been introduced already and the players now have some comfort with working with another player, the 2v1 will go differently than it would have above. On the attacking side, the attacker now has that second attacker he was wishing for, remembers how beneficial the teamwork was for the two defenders, and will be more inclined to work with his partner. 

On the defensive side, your defender will gain a true appreciation for having a partner to work with. Keeping track of the ball, the goal, and the second attacker will be extremely difficult. If only they had a second defender with them to relay some of that information! The lack of information will go a long way in motivating communication between your players.

###2v2
Now we bring it all together and mix aspects of both the 1v2 and the 2v1. The attackers will be wary of the dangers of getting into a 1v2 situation and will be aware of the advantages of working with their teammate.

Defenders will already have a base method of communication from their 1v2 work to expand upon and already know that they need to work together to succeed. With that base, they will be able to focus on how to deal with the movement of the second attacker and how to switch roles.

##Exercises
First and foremost, remember to stress that the purpose of these exercises is to give your players problems to solve. This is their laboratory in which to experiment. They shouldn’t be afraid to try new things and they shouldn’t be afraid to fail over and over again while they do so.

###1v2
(Image showing four cones to define a rectangle (dimensions to be determined), and a pop-up goal on one end. The two defenders are on the end with the goal and the attacker is on the opposite end. The coach is on one of the other two longer sides with the balls.)

The first defender starts coming out to defend. As he approaches the midway point, the coach feeds the ball to the attacker. The goal is to have the attacker and defender meet at around one-fourth of the way to the goal. The second defender counts to five Mississippi after the feed and then comes to support. I will explain the drill to my players as follows:

>“Defense is always easier when you have an extra defender. If you try to steal the ball by yourself and miss, the attacker runs free straight to goal. Instead, slow your opponent down until help arrives. When we do this exercise, one of you will start defending by themselves. As you come out to defend, yell “I got ball!” to let your partner know that you’re defending the player with the ball. Lead the attacker off to the side and away from goal; don’t try to steal the ball immediately. Turn your body in the direction you want him to go and always be blocking the goal. Your partner will count to five Mississippi and then come help you. The support player will be talking to the defender the whole time, telling him where he is and what the defender should do. The support player should say things like, “I’m on your left!” or, “Force him right!” Once you have your support find the right time to steal the ball (see: 1v1 Training (TODO:1v1 Training)). If you fail, your support is there to back you up.”

###2v1
(Image showing four cones to define a rectangle (dimensions to be determined), and a pop-up goal on one end. One defender is on the end with the goal and the two attackers are on the opposite end. The coach is on one of the other two longer sides with the balls.)

The defender starts coming out to defend. As he approaches the midway point, the coach feeds the ball to one of the attackers. The goal is to have the attackers and defender meet at around one-fourth of the way to the goal.

When I present this exercise I will start by talking about the attackers to motivate the teamwork aspect:

>“Remember how difficult it was to play against two defenders on your own? Now you have someone to pass to and one less defender. Work together, be creative, and make the defender run back and forth. As the supporting attacker, point to where you want your pass to go. If you want it at your feet, point to your feet. If you want it out in front, point out in front.”

On the defensive side, you want to direct your defender to do two things. Firstly, they need to block the goal. That will always be the most important thing. Secondarily, he must also try to prevent the two attackers from working together. At first, it will be difficult for them to do both things at once, so make the second objective easier. I will prompt my defenders with:

>“Defender, now you have two players to worry about and no support. Your first priority is always to prevent a shot on goal. But, you also need to be ready for the attacker to pass to his partner. So, work on keeping track of the location of the goal and the position of the attacker without the ball at all times. Constantly ask yourself, ‘Where is the goal? Where is the other attacker?’”

By prompting the defender to think about only his location, he has freedom to experiment. Also, with your defender by himself, he will be missing his support; he will gain a better appreciation of having that defensive partner. By forcing him to think about both attackers while alone, it will be easier to do so when with a partner.

If the defenders get discouraged, remind them that this is supposed to be hard for them. They should experiment with their positioning and figure out what works best.

###2v2
(Image showing four cones to define a rectangle (dimensions to be determined), and a pop-up goal on one end. Two defenders are on the end with the goal and the two attackers are on the opposite end. The coach is on one of the other two longer sides with the balls.)

This time, the defenders come out at the same time as the feed. This is to force the defenders to decide who “has ball”.
I will prompt my players as follows:

>“Attackers, don’t get caught in a 1v2. You remember how difficult that was. If both defenders are defending you that means there is no one defending your partner. Continue to point to where you want your passes. Defenders, how should you position yourself as the supporting defender? That’s the main problem for you to solve. You still need to support your partner, but you also need to be ready to defend the other attacker if the ball is passed to him. And if the ball is passed, you need to switch roles. Make sure you are talking to each other. Shout, ‘I got ball!’ when you are taking ball. Shout, ‘Force him left!’ when you want your partner to force the attacker to go to the left. Shout, ‘Switch!’ when a pass is played and you are switching roles.”
