You should have a way that you want your team to play at the professional level.

That method of playing should then be played at every level in the club.

At each level, you should pinpoint what skills the players should be working on. This includes technical skills, tactical skills, physical skills, mental skills.

##Overall Strategy

How do you attack with the ball? How do you defend with the ball? Tell me how you attack, and I will tell you how you should defend. The transition from attack to defense is very important. Taking too much time reorganizing yourself will allow the opposing team to organize themselves, or worse hit quickly on the counterattack.

##Attack

So, how do you want to attack? Starting from the back, you should be able to play with three and four at the back. The system will be different depending on if there are three or four at the back. 
You may also run into the situation of having more of a wing-back on one side that plays much higher up on the field and shuttles down the line. That player must have good pace and endurance to own that sideline.

I like having a single defensive midfielder that can drop back into the defensive line or can step forward into the attack. This is a huge ask for any player as it requires them to be able to play three positions and be physically capable of being strong defensively and quick in attack. Watch videos of Busquets to see how he plays. Him explaining how he plays would be even better.
The team should be compact. They should move as a unit when building an attack. I like the analogy of a team climbing a mountain. They slowly progress, moving the anchors up the mountain, staying together.

I like a high defensive line and a strong pressing game. However, it is evident that a team is unable to intensely press for ninety minutes, therefore, the team must also be able to contain their opponents. The team must be able to be compact in the defensive third and able to withstand extended periods of attacking pressure from their opponents.

The attacking play should have an overarching theme, but should be versatile such that it can adapt to expose the weaknesses of the opposing team.

##Defense

###General

How do the players adapt to being pulled out of position? When do they stop tracking a player out of their own position?

###Stopping Playmakers

I like the method that Manchester United has been using with Phil Jones recently. They use a player that is something between a defensive midfielder and a center-back to man-mark the playmaker whenever he is in the attacking half. 

It is most important to not get beaten 1-on-1. While it is best to win the ball from them, it is also very good to get him to pass the ball.

###Specific Drills

**Through Balls and Shooting**

Trains: Weighting passes, Running onto a ball, Shooting, Goalkeeping

3 people (easiest) – A passes ball from stop to Cone. B runs onto ball, shooting on goal first time. B should hit the ball as it arrives as Cone. B should get the ball on target before increasing power. C waits behind A with ball. C goes to A. A goes to B. B follows shot, gets ball, and goes to C.

3 people - C becomes goalkeeper. C tries to get ball and go to A. B tries to score off rebounds.

4 people - D feeds ball to A. A hits first time or takes a touch. D goes to A. C goes to D.

4 people – Put barrel between A and Cone.

5 people – E Stands between A and Cone. E cannot move, but can try to block with feet. A goes to E. E goes to B.

6 people – F runs ball side and slightly behind B. Puts light pressure on B. F goes to B. E goes to F.

Variations: Alternate feet for the passes and shots. Increase distance from A to Cone and Cone to goal. Bend it around barrel and E both ways.

##Player Qualities

###Fullbacks

Fullbacks should be both strong and fast. They must contribute to the attacking and defensive phases of play. Their 1-on-1 skills in both attack and defense must be developed. Fullbacks can either attack via crosses from the wings or by cutting inside. It is preferable to have footedness align with the side that is occupied.

###Wingbacks

Almost the same as a fullback in the modern game. The wingback will be up higher on the pitch more often. His attacking attributes are more important.

###Midfielders

This position is extremely varied. It depends on how you want to balance your team.

###Wingers

There are two types of wingers. The classical winger and the inverted winger. The winger needs speed and dribbling skills regardless. They must be able to beat their opponent. This will draw another opponent to them, opening up space within the penalty box. Even if someone is an inverted winger, they should still be able to deliver crosses in the instance that they are unable to cut inside. If the opponents are playing very narrow, the flanks will be exposed.

###Goalkeeper

Tall and long people are preferred as this will help them deal with crosses. They must also be able to read the game. Since goalkeepers cannot pick up back passes, they must know where they are going to go with the ball when it arrives. The positioning of the goalkeeper vertically is also very important. They provide additional balance to the team vertically. They should come out of the goal when the ball is deep in the opposing half to provide an outlet, to sweep up long clearances, to deter long balls into space behind to allow counterattacks. The goalkeeper must also have fast reflexes. This is something that needs to be worked on constantly. Can you find a way to measure and improve reflexes. (That will likely be beneficial for all players and people in general.) Goalkeepers must be brave. They need to be able to dive in front of players’ feet and be prepared for injury to prevent a goal. They must also have a special quality in their concentration as they have to deal with going from doing nothing for a long period to doing a lot in a short period. (How can this be trained?)

###Center Backs

Tall, strong, good header of the ball, good tackler, good at blocking shots are very important skills. The quicker the center-back is, the better. It is also a huge plus to have central defenders that can read the game. There was some defender that felt that the number of tackles he made in a game was the number of mistakes he made. The best defenders should never get into a position where they need to make a tackle to prevent a goal. Interceptions are much better.

###Target Man

Strong and physical to be able to guard the ball and hold up play. He needs good technique to also be able to play short balls to keep play from becoming predictable. Heading and finishing skills are also (obviously) important.

###Playmaker

##Game Preparation

##Training

###General

Drills should be different for different age groups. It would be cool to have drills that have a goal and are measurable, such that improvement can be tracked.

##Formations

###General

Formations are hard to describe in a series of numbers. The goal and micro-structure of the players can vary immensely between to implementations. The midfield in any formation can be set up in any number of ways. A triangle and be flipped, a square can be a diamond, and even within those descriptors, there is no mention of how players move forward, if there is rotation, how they defend.

###5-3-2

I hope to never play this formation. It is an extremely defensive formation. The importance is on the wing-backs. I should know how to beat a team that organizes like this on defense though. And I should know how to defend against a team that attacks in this way.

###3-5-2

This formation places three defenders within the width of the penalty area. It is a good defensive scheme when you are playing a very narrow team. The downfall of this formation defensively is that you concede the wide areas. The way to make up for this is to play with outside center-backs that are comfortable as fullbacks. If they are comfortable with those duties, then they can defend out wide if the ball is in that area. When one of the center-backs goes out wide, this will require someone to step into the position the defender left. One way to do this is to play with a defensive midfielder that drops into the defensive line. When England played with this formation, they would have the outside center-backs go out wide as soon as a ball was threatened to play out wide. Cruyff also played with method at Ajax.

With defenders playing in the above way, you can play with attacking players on the wings.

###4-3-3

The main benefit of this formation is having three central midfield players. The midfield trio usually consists of a defensive player with two attacking players. One player can easily get forward, and assuming the other can get back during transitions, you will usually be okay while the forward midfielder is recovering.

The main decision is how you play your wide attackers. This can fuzz the formation between a 4-3-3 and a 4-5-1 or somewhere in between. Playing with true wingers gives you players on the outside who naturally like to take on defenders and get forward and provide crosses. Defensively, it is important what the wide attackers do when possession is lost. Ideally, they have the pace an endurance to get back into defense, but you may not have two players who can do that.
The main problem is how you support the striker in the penalty box. It will require your midfield getting forward and it will require your wide attackers getting into the box.

###4-5-1

How do you use the five midfielders? The orientation of the central midfield triangle will be informative. One or two defensive midfielders? This formation can leave the central forward isolated. This tends to result in having a midfield triangle of one defensive player and two attacking players. This way, the two attacking players can support the striker. There will be a lot of space for the wide players to exploit. The way they play will depend on the type of players they are and the type of defense you are playing against.

Defensively, this is a strong defensive formation. If you are sitting deep, you have two banks of four with a defensive midfield that can roam between the lines of mark a specific player. When you are using this formation to sit deep, it is important to have a striker that can hold the ball up well so you can have time to move forward as a team. Pacey wide players will help in providing an outlet to the striker.

###4-1-3-2

This is a narrow formation. The fullbacks are relied on for the width. The defensive midfielder is vital in attack, as he should be available for a ball played back. One of the three attacking midfielders is expected to get forward with the strikers during the attack.

###4-4-2

The two strikers up front gives you a way to be threatening from long balls. There is another forward around to pass to, or another forward to threaten the back of the defense. It is more common these days to have the two forwards playing vertically instead of horizontal. The two central midfielders provide cover for the defense and also serve as the creators of the attack. The wide midfielders get forward and provide width. Along with the fullbacks, they from units of two on the wings for both attack and defense. The overall formation begins to look like a bunch of pairs.

##Club Management

###Analysts

I should request video compilations of certain things from every game (and practice). Analyst should prove notes on each instance. Analyst will be present when I watch the videos to discuss notes.

###Interns

Notes/Reports on everything (games, practices, analysis, etc). Notes should include all questions. I will seek out Intern later to address questions and discuss notes.

##Skills

###Touches

- Side to side roll: Roll the ball from inside of boot to outside of boot and back. Concentrate on balance of your standing leg and keeping contact with the ball at all times.
- Heel roll: Roll the ball from heel to toe and back. Concentrate on balance of your standing leg and keeping contact with the ball at all times.
- Inside roll: Roll the ball across yourself using the inside of your boot and rolling it across the bottom of your boot. Stop the ball with your opposite foot.
- Outside in roll: Start with the ball in the center. Use the outside of your boot to roll the ball outside your body. Use the inside of the same foot to tap the ball back towards your center.
- Roll in front then behind: Use inside of boot to roll the ball out in front of yourself, stopping the ball with the outside of your foot. Roll the ball back to the starting point. Use the inside of your foot to roll the ball behind yourself, stopping the ball with the outside of your toe. Roll the ball back to the starting point.
- Over-unders: Start with the ball outside. Roll the ball across yourself using the bottom of your foot. With that same foot, step in front of the path of the ball so that it  rolls across yourself in front of your other foot but behind your starting foot. Stop the ball with your other foot on the outside of your body.
- Tick tocks: Tap the ball between your feet using your instep. Keep it tight and fast.
- Toe taps: Alternate touching the ball with your toes. Tap the top of the ball.

###Dribbling

Control dribbling uses all parts of the foot. In tight situations. You never know how you’ll need to move the ball to escape, so comfort with all parts of the foot is important. The inside the foot is the most common control dribble.

Speed dribbling uses the top of the foot. You want to push the ball out in front of yourself using the top of your foot. You should not break stride to make contact with the ball. Lock your ankle and point your toes down and slightly inward when pushing the ball. Start very slowly at walking pace, getting a feeling for the mechanics. Increase speed after time. Work on transitioning your dribbling into a cut, a pass, and a shot.
